# ---------------------------- ACCESS_CONTROL ----------------------------

# Used to configure whether to enable access control to the file system.
# If enabled, only access to the provided pre-set folders (including those provided by sd-webui and manually \
# added to Quick Move or specified via IIB_ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOWED_PATHS) will be allowed.
# The available options are 'enable', 'disable', and 'auto'.
# The default value is 'auto', which will be determined based on the command-line parameters used to start sd-webui (such as --server-name, --share, --listen).
IIB_ACCESS_CONTROL=auto

# This variable is used to define a list of allowed paths for the application to access when access control mode is enabled. 
# It can be set to a comma-separated string of file paths or directory paths, representing the resources that are allowed to be accessed by the application.
# In addition, if sd_webui_config or sd_webui_dir has been configured, or if you're running this repository as an extension of sd-webui, 
# you can use the following shortcuts (txt2img, img2img, extra, save) as values for the ALLOWED_PATHS variable.
# IIB_ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOWED_PATHS=save,extra,/output   ...etc

# This variable is used to control fine-grained access control for different types of requests, but only if access control mode is enabled. 
# It can be set to a string value that represents a specific permission or set of permissions, such as "read-only", "write-only", "read-write", or "no-access". 
# This variable can be used to restrict access to certain API endpoints or data sources based on the permissions required by the user. 
# IIB_ACCESS_CONTROL_PERMISSION=read-write
